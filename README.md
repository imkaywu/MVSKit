PM-MVS

The implementation of the PatchMatch MVS in the scene space.

Traditionally, PM-based method need to traverse all the pixels in each viewpoint several iterations. We instead came up with a way to traverse the 3D point, which significantly improve the speed of the algorithm without losing accuracy.
